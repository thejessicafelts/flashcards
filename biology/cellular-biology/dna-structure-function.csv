"Course: BIO 171: Cellular Biology Unit: 3 Chapter: 14: DNA Structure and Function     The process of DNA replication can be summarized as follows: 1. DNA unwinds at the origin of replication. 2. Helicase opens up the DNA-forming replication fork; these are extended bidirectionally. 3. Single-strand binding proteins coat the DNA around the replication fork to prevent rewinding of the DNA. 4. Topoisomerase binds at the region ahead of the replication fork to prevent supercoiling. 5. Primase synthesizes RNA primers complementary to the DNA strand. 6. DNA Polymerase III starts adding nucleotides to the 3'-OH end of the primer. 7. [...] of both the [...] and the [...] continutes. 8. RNA primers are removed by exonuclease activity. 9.
